## Working on the client locally

You will need to ensure that you have .Net 4.6.2 Framework and .Net core 2.0 installed on your machine.
If you are not working on a windows OS, .Net Frameworks are not supported but you can use the Makefile to build and run tests, run `make` on your terminal to see the available options.

## Tests

Before running tests please ensure that the environment variables are set up for the test project.

```
NOTIFY_API_URL "https://example.notify-api.url"
API_KEY "example_API_test_key"
FUNCTIONAL_TEST_NUMBER "valid mobile number"
FUNCTIONAL_TEST_EMAIL "valid email address"
EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID "valid email_template_id"
SMS_TEMPLATE_ID "valid sms_template_id"
LETTER_TEMPLATE_ID "valid letter_template_id"
SMS_SENDER_ID "valid sms_sender_id - to test sending to a receiving number, so needs to be a real number"
API_SENDING_KEY "API_whitelist_key for sending an SMS to a receiving number"
INBOUND_SMS_QUERY_KEY "API_test_key to get received text messages"
```

## Deploying the client to Bintray
If you are a member of the Notify team go to the latest build on https://jenkins.notify.tools/job/run-app-veyor-build/, re-run this build with the `PUBLISH_TO_BINTRAY` checked.
